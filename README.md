# Interface for search on stackoverflow.
Link to demo: http://piano-test.albert-allagulov.com

The interface contains several screens:
 - Input to enter the word that will be contained in the title of the question
 - List of questions received by word in title
 - List of questions in an additional field, received by tag or by author
 - Additional information on the subject. Now it contains scarce information on the answers, due to rest api restrictions
  
It is planned to do pagination of questions and animation of elements.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
